# 4 Project learnings
Throughout the Computer Science Department website project, I,have enhanced my skills by delving into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals. This included gaining a deeper understanding of creating reusable components, managing state, and manipulating the DOM using JavaScript. Overcoming initial challenges, I successfully implemented responsive design principles, ensuring the website's optimal performance across various devices.

The introduction of multiple pages prompted me to master navigation techniques in JavaScript, allowing for seamless transitions between different sections. Dynamic content for staff profiles and student projects became an integral part of my skill set. I solidified my understanding of state management, utilizing JavaScript to effectively handle dynamic content such as upcoming events and the course catalog.

Despite restrictions on frameworks, I honed my CSS skills, experimenting with styling techniques to create a visually appealing and cohesive design for the website. This project served as a significant learning experience, fostering growth in my abilities as a web developer with a focus on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
