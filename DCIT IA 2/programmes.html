        <h2>UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMMES</h2>
        <p>The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.</p>

        <p>To qualify for admission into Computer Science programmes at Level 200, candidates must have taken the following courses at Level 100:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>MATH 121: Algebra and Trigonometry</li>
            <li>MATH 122: Calculus I</li>
            <li>CSCD 101: Introduction to Computer Science I</li>
            <li>CSCD 102: Introduction to Computer Science II</li>
        </ul>
    
        <p>Every student in the Department of Computer Science must own his or her laptop with a minimum specification of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>i3 64-bit Processor</li>
            <li>8GB RAM</li>
            <li>500GB HD or 256 SSD</li>
        </ul>
        

        <h2>POSTGRADUATE PROGRAMMES</h2>
       <p> The Department of Computer Science  University of Ghana currently runs Masters of Science (MSc.)
         in Computer Science and Master of Philosophy (MPhil.) in Computer Science.</p> 


       <p> The MSc. is a 1-year (weekend/evening) programme with a capstone project while the MPhil is a 2-year (full-time) programme.
         The first year of the MPhil is taught course and second year is research and dissertation.
         Both programmes are accelerated masters programme specially designed to train current and future 
         computer scientist who are available for full-time or part-time study.</p>
        

        <p>Students who enrolled in these programmes are equipped with broader knowledge in theoretical computer science 
        and advance technical skills to approach science in technology as a disruptive force to
         manage complex problems of the global society. At the end of these programmes, students will gain hands-on experience in solving complex,
          and unstructured scientific problems while learning subjects like Advance Databases, Advance Data Structures and Algorithms and Networks</p>
        
            <li>Master of Science in Computer Science</li>
            <li>MPhil in Computer Science</li>
            <!-- Add more programs as needed -->
